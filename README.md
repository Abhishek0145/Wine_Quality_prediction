# Wine Quality Prediction ML Model

## Overview

This repository contains code and resources for building a Machine Learning model to predict the quality of wine based on various features. The model is designed to assist in evaluating the quality of wines, which can be particularly useful for winemakers and enthusiasts.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training and testing the model is the "Wine Quality" dataset, which can be found here [https://github.com/Abhishek0145/Wine_Quality_prediction)]. This dataset contains information about various attributes of wine samples, such as acidity, alcohol content, and more, along with their corresponding quality ratings.

## Model

The ML model in this repository is built using Python and popular libraries like scikit-learn, pandas, and numpy. It uses various algorithm like Random Forest Classifier, ADA Boost Classifier, Bagging Classifer and others to make predictions. The model is trained on a portion of the dataset and evaluated on another portion to assess its performance.

## Usage

To use this model for wine quality prediction, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

```
git clone [https://github.com/Abhishek0145/Wine_Quality_prediction/blob/main/Wine%20Prediction%20Model%20using%20Linear%20Regression.ipynb]
```

2. Install the required dependencies.

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script to train and test the model.

```
python winequality-red.py
```

4. Provide input data with wine attributes to get predictions on wine quality.

## Results

The model's performance and evaluation metrics, such as accuracy, precision, and recall, can be found in the notebook or script's output. These metrics will help you assess how well the model predicts wine quality.

## Future Improvements

To improve the model's performance, you can consider the following:

- Collect more data for training.
- Experiment with different machine learning algorithms.
- Fine-tune hyperparameters.
- Feature engineering to include additional relevant attributes.
